@TODO:
Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers,
find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.
In case of multiple sub-arrays, return the subarray which comes first on moving from left to right.

For example : A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] , N = 10, S = 15
Output: A[:5]
